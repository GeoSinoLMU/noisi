### Installation

Install requirements (easiest done with anaconda)
[obspy](https://docs.obspy.org/)

If installing in a conda environment with pip, pip will try to fulfill most requirements automatically.

If you encounter problems with mpi4py, try reinstalling it using pip (`pip install mpi4py`).

Clone the repository with git:
`git clone https://github.com/lermert/noisi_v1.git`

Change into the top noisi_v1/ directory. Call `pip install -v` .

After installation, consider running `pytest` in the `noisi_v1/noisi_v1` directory.
