# "date_created": added automatically, no need to edit
# "mtype": type of measurement; choose between "ln_energy_ratio",
# "square_envelope", "energy_diff"
# "taper_perc": 0.01,
# "bandpass": [[0.05,0.1,5]]: Bandpass filters (list of (lower, upper, order)).
#    Each entry and bandpass list will produce one measurement
# "weights": [1.0]: Weights of measurements in same order as bandpass filters
# "ignore_network": When matching data and synthetics, setting this parameter
#    to true means that only station codes are considered (e.g. II.BFO..LHZ and
#    BF.BFO..LHZ will be regarded as the same channel.)

# all the following parameters are for measurements in approx. 
#    surface wave window:
# "g_speed": # estimated Rayleigh wave group speed
# "window_params_wtype": window type; choose between "hann" and "boxcar"
# "window_params_hw": half width of window
# "window_params_win_overlap": for short distances, windows may overlap. 
#    If this parameter is set to true, such measurements will still be taken.
# "window_params_sep_noise": Separation of noise window from signal window 
#    in multiples of window halfwidth
# "window_plot_measurements": plot or not
